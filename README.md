In the tradition of hypertext adaptations of Ludwig Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1922), this version attempts to create a simple, single-page (except for image links) HTML version with minimal, optional CSS for readability.

The project was mainly prompted by my discovery of the HTML `<details>` disclosure element.

Included files:
* tractatus.txt — Plain text version of the German 1922 version of the Tractatus
* generator.py — Script to generate the HTML page from the plain text Tractatus
